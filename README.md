# Living Lend
## Description
Living Lend is a convenient and affordable solution for those who want to furnish their living spaces without the expense and hassle of purchasing furniture. With Living Lend, users can easily browse a wide selection of furniture styles and pieces, select the items they need, and choose a rental period that best suits their needs. Our rental periods are flexible, ranging from one month to several months, so users can rent furniture for as long as they need it.
Furthermore, by renting furniture, users can make a more sustainable choice. Renting furniture reduces waste and carbon emissions associated with the production and disposal of new furniture, making it a more environmentally-friendly option.
